Create a client and server using python Flask for a multiplayer chess game. Each player makes two moves each turn. 

Which is stored in this class:

'''python
class Move:
    def __init__(self, position, movement_type = 1, french_revolution = False, spawn_piece = Pion) -> None:
        self.position = position
        self.french_revolution = french_revolution
        self.movement_type = movement_type
'''

Make a system where a client can connect and then wait for another to be matched in a game. Create a class to store and handle individual games.
